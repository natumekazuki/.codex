# Copies to a temp directory first (same filesystem as the destination, so the
# final swap is a cheap rename rather than a cross-device copy), then swaps it
# into place. NOTE: replacing an *existing* directory with another directory
# is not a single atomic filesystem operation on POSIX (there is no atomic
# "directory rename that also replaces a non-empty destination directory"),
# so this is a best-effort two-step swap (move old dir aside, move new dir
# in), guarded by a trap that restores the previous skills/natural-japanese/
# if the script is interrupted between those two steps.
#
# The backup path is suffixed with the PID ($$) so two concurrent runs of
# this script don't clobber each other's backup.
